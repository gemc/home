## Getting Started

We'll create a simple geometry consisting of a target and a flux detector. 

### Create a counter systema

Create a `counter` system to count the number of particles crossing a plane at some distance from the target. 

``` 
system_template.py -s counter
```


### Create the geometry


### Inspect the yaml file

### Run gemc
