**GEMC** is a database-driven Monte Carlo simulation program based on [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch).
Key features include:<br/>

- Python API for geometry and materials
- `ASCII`, `SQLite`, `GDML`, `CAD` support
- Built-in `ASCII`, `CSV` and [`ROOT`](https://root.cern) output formats
- Custom extensibility of digitization, output formats, e.m. fields.
- [`pyvista`](https://https://pyvista.org) 3D visualization and import. 
- CAD / meshes support

<br/>

## Databases

Running simulations does not require previous knowledge of C++ or Geant4. A typical workflow looks like this:

 1. Geant4 geometry and materials are uploaded to databases using `python`
 2. GEMC reads databases and builds the Geant4 world
 3. Particles are transported by Geant4. 
 4. Hits are digitized and streamed to the desired formats.

   Users can add run time conditions, particles, etc. Geant4's steps are collected in hits, digitized and streamed. "

## Python API
GEMC does not need to be re-compiled when the geometry is changed.

`Python` is used to create and upload to databases the geometry, materials, mirrors, etc.
The API supports [`pyvista`](https://https://pyvista.org) visualization of the geometry.

   width="1900"
%}


```python
	gvolume = GVolume('flux_box')
	gvolume.description = 'carbon fiber box'
	gvolume.make_box(40.0, 40.0, 2.0)
	gvolume.material    = 'carbonFiber'
	gvolume.color       = '3399FF'
	gvolume.digitization = 'flux'
	gvolume.set_position(0, 0, 100)
	gvolume.style       = 1
	gvolume.set_identifier('box', 2)  # identifier for this box
	gvolume.publish(configuration)
 ```


<br/><br/>


## Geometry Variations 

A detector can be re-used in multiple experiments, with configuration changes such as components shifts, 
changes of materials, addition or removal of certain volumes.
GEMC Supports these geometry versions using **variations** and/or run **numbers** to adapt to different simulation setups

{% include figure.html
   src="assets/images/clas12v.gif"
   alt="Python API example"
   caption="In the above animation two variations of the CLAS12 Central Detector are shown. 
   The geometries are identical except for the position of the target. They can be selected
   by specifying a variation string or a run number in the configuration file or command line options.
   "

## Status Badges

Gemc is built on several platforms and both arm64, amd64 architectures for every commit and pull request. 
In addition, nightly releases are built and deployed the Github repository.
