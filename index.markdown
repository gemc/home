**GEMC** is a database-driven Monte Carlo simulation program based on [Geant4](https://geant4.web.cern.ch).
Key features include:<br/>

- Python API for database I/O of geometry and materials
- No need to know, write or compile C++ or Geant4 code
- Built-in `ASCII`, `CSV` and [`ROOT`](https://root.cern) output formats
- Custom extensibility of signal digitization, output formats, e.m. fields, hardware electronics. 
- [`pyvista`](https://https://pyvista.org) 3D visualization and meshes support

<br/>



## Databases

Geant4 objects are uploaded to databases using the python API. Running simulations looks like this:

 1. GEMC reads databases (`ASCII`, `SQLite`, `GDML`, `CAD` files) to create the Geant4 volumes, materials, surfaces, etc.
 2. Generated particle are transported through the geometry by Geant4. 
 3. The resulting hits are processed, collected and digitized. 
 4. Outputs are streamed to the desired formats.

## Python API

`Python` is used to create and upload to databases the geometry, materials, mirrors, etc.
GEMC does not need to be re-compiled when the geometry is changed. The API supports [`pyvista`](https://https://pyvista.org) 
visualization of the geometry.

%}


```python
	gvolume = GVolume('flux_box')
	gvolume.description = 'carbon fiber box'
	gvolume.make_box(40.0, 40.0, 2.0)
	gvolume.material    = 'carbonFiber'
	gvolume.color       = '3399FF'
	gvolume.digitization = 'flux'
	gvolume.set_position(0, 0, 100)
	gvolume.style       = 1
	gvolume.set_identifier('box', 2)  # identifier for this box
	gvolume.publish(configuration)
 ```


<br/><br/>


## Geometry Variations 

A detector can be re-used in multiple experiments, with configuration changes such as components shifts, 
changes of materials, addition or removal of certain volumes.
GEMC Supports these geometry versions using **variations** and/or run **numbers** to adapt to different simulation setups

{% include figure.html
   src="assets/images/clas12v.gif"
   alt="Python API example"
   caption="In the above animation two variations of the CLAS12 Central Detector are shown. 
   The geometries are identical except for the position of the target. They can be selected
   by specifying a variation string or a run number in the configuration file or command line options.

## Status Badges

Gemc is built on several platforms and both arm64, amd64 architectures for every commit and pull request. 
In addition, nightly releases are built and deployed the Github repository.
